minor_changes:
  - ansible-test - Containers and remotes managed by ansible-test will have their Python ``EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`` marker (PEP668) removed.
    This provides backwards compatibility for existing tests running in newer environments which mark their Python as externally managed.
    A future version of ansible-test may change this behavior, requiring tests to be adapted to such environments.
