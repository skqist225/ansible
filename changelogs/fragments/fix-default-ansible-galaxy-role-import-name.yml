    ``ansible-galaxy role import`` - fix using the ``role_name`` in a standalone role's
    ``galaxy_info`` metadata by disabling automatic removal of the ``ansible-role-`` prefix.
    This matches the behavior of the Galaxy UI which also no longer implicitly removes the
    ``ansible-role-`` prefix.
    Use the ``--role-name`` option or add a ``role_name`` to the ``galaxy_info`` dictionary
    in the role's ``meta/main.yml`` to use an alternate role name.
