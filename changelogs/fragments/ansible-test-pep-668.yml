minor_changes:
- ansible-test - When ansible-test installs requirements, it now instructs pip to allow installs on externally managed environments as defined by PEP 668.
                 This only occurs in ephemeral environments managed by ansible-test, such as containers, or when the `--requirements` option is used.
